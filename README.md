# signal-archive
The purpose of this Python code is to transform a Signal backup file into an archived HTML format which has a look similar to the Signal app and a search feature. I created this project in order to archive the chats from my beloved brother Sauli Peltom√§ki's (1996-2021) phone and to share them with family members and Sauli's friends. The current code supports only the backup format used at the time I pulled the backup's from my brother's phone; I did this on 20.5.2021. This project is dedicated to Sauli.

# Usage
* Use <https://github.com/pajowu/signal-backup-decode> to decrypt the Signal backup file. After this step, you should have a directory with subdirectories `attachment`, `avatar`, `preference`, `sticker` and file `signal_backup.db`.
* Create a JSON file describing which contact or group to process. The key `contact` (as in the example file) refers to contacts (single persons) and the key `group` to groups.
* When the example JSON file is run, a directory `archived` will be created in the current directory. If such a directory already exists, files can be overwritten.
* Default recipient (key `default_recipient`) needs to be specified. The default recipient is the person from whose phone the backups are from.
* The values of the key `contacts` allow to rename contacts and provide avatar files for each contact if they exist (this needs to be done manually as the files produced by signal-backup-decode do not allow to determine the avatar of a contact).

# Misc
* The format is designed in such a way that the body contents of the HTML files can be concatenated. Thus if you receive new messages but do not have older backups, do not worry and just concatenate to obtain one whole file. Obviously files under `attachments` need to be copied as well.
