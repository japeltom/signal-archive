# signal-archive
The purpose of this Python code is to transform a Signal backup file into an archived HTML format which has a look similar to the Signal app and a search feature. I created this project in order to archive the chats from my beloved brother Sauli Peltom√§ki's (1996-2021) phone and to share them with family members and Sauli's friends. The current code supports only the backup format used at the time I pulled the backup's from my brother's phone; I did this on 20.5.2021. This project is dedicated to Sauli.
